===========================
2D MINKOWSKI TENSOR PACKAGE
===========================

This program calculates the Minkowski valuations of planar shapes.

The program uses an external library called "Eigen" for the vector subroutines.
For your convenience, the relevant headers are included in this package.
"Eigen" can be obtained from

    http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

and is available under the GNU General Public License.

The program uses an external library called "GetOpt_pp" for parsing the command
line.
For your convenience, the relevant headers are included in this package.
"GetOpt_pp" can be obtained from

    http://code.google.com/p/getoptpp/

and is available under the GNU General Public License, version 3.


==================
BUILDING & TESTING
==================

Type "make" to compile.

Type "make DEBUG=0" to create a version without debugging code.

Type "make test" to run the (currently minimal) testsuite.


==========================
REQUIREMENTS ON INPUT DATA
==========================

Input data can be provided either in pixelized form, i.e. as a 
digital image with square pixels or as a series of polygons.
Currently, the code processes images in .pgm format and reads
polygons out of .poly files.  Further readers can be written
by the user.

The data to be analyzed should be free of singular entities like
 contours consisting of a single vertex
 contours having edges with length zero
 contours having inflections of pi or minus pi

Data generated from pixelized images via marching squares algorithm does
not have such problems.  There is code to "fix" existing data which
has features like the above by deleting the offending vertices (see
function fix_contours).


=================================
DOCUMENTATION OF POLY FILE FORMAT
=================================

FIXME


================================
DOCUMENTATION OF PGM FILE FORMAT
================================

These files are plain portable graymaps, as introduced by the netpbm
package ages ago.  Note that for example GIMP defaults to writing
binary PGM ("P5").  Choose ASCII instead ("P2").


==============
KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

0. Documentation incomplete, and I know it.  I'm sorry.  If you have a
   problem using this package, don't hesitate to contact me.

1. When calculating the MV of a pixelised dataset, and using domainwise
   analysis, you should not choose the clipping rectangle on integral
   coordinates.  Instead, choose coordinates like 10.5, or even 10.0001.

   This avoids a bug where an odd number of intersects between a ray
   and a contour is found.
