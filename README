2D MINKOWSKI TENSOR PACKAGE
===========================





The program uses an external library called "Eigen" for the vector subroutines.
For your convenience, the relevant headers are included in this package.
"Eigen" can be obtained from

    http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

and is available under the GNU General Public License.


==========================
REQUIREMENTS ON INPUT DATA
==========================

Input data can be provided either in pixelized form, i.e. as a 
digital image with square pixels or as a series of polygons.
Currently, the code processes images in .pgm format and reads
polygons out of .poly files.  Further readers can be written
by the user.

The data to be analyzed should be free of singular entities like
 contours consisting of a single vertex
 contours having edges with length zero
 contours having inflections of pi or minus pi

Data generated from pixelized images via marching squares algorithm does
not have such problems.  There is code to "fix" existing data which
has features like the above by deleting the offending vertices (see
function fix_contours).
