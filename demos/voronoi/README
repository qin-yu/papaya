Poisson-Voronoi demo

The Python script 'poisson' creates a few realizations of a Poisson process;
the script can be used to run them through Papaya, for example like this:

    echo size1/*.xyz | xargs -n1 ./voronoi

The resulting data files can be evaluated to reproduce the known results for
Poisson-Voronoi tesselations.
